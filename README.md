Installations required in order to run the files:
	- pip install transforms3D
	- pip install numpy
	- pip install msgpack-rpc-python
	- pip install backports.ssl_match_hostname
	- pip install gymnasium
	- pip install stable-baselines3
  	- pip install airsim

Additional steps:
  - We ran this in an Anaconda environment, that is the recommended way to run this code. The python version is Python 3.12.3 with Anaconda3 
  - Make sure the 'Block' environment is running once you run one of the python files.
  - Make sure the 'AirSim' Git repository folder is installed at the same location as the python files (Like in this GitHub repo)
  - To run one of the python files, either run from your preffered IDE, or run the file from a terminal with: ```python <filename.py>```

Additional Information:
  - If there is an issue with not enough space required for the bufferm the 'buffer_size' value can be modified.
